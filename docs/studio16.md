2a. In C++, an interface is the functionality that a class provides for the client code to interact with the class,
including functions and all non-private members. To have an abstract class (or an interface that we want to be inherited),
all functions that we want to be inherited and later overwritten should be declared as virtual in the base class, and once 
again virtual in all of the subsequent inherited classes. Also, "override" should be added every time the function is 
overwritten in the inherited classes.

3. 
a. This is interface inheritance, since no implimentation was inherited.
b. Private, since we only want to access those variables within the text file class.  COME BACK
